MIPT DREC lectures, seminars, homeworks, labs &amp; lots more

I'll quickly describe the nuances:

* Not all of the seminars have been written because of many reasons: skipped class (for good reasons), already written material & so on
* The homework can be **helpful** to you (because it may contain some of your tasks)
* Lectures have some important info, mainly use books to prepare for everything
